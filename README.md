Analyzing the US EPA Landfill Methane Outreach Program, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, and archiving relevant data.

Author: **William Nicholas**, Indiana University O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs

This repository contains an **in-progress** analysis of landfills in the United States, and an assessment of the Landfill Methane Outreach Program, including current and candidate projects, as well as selected elements of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Data comes from the US EPA via the [Landfill Methane Outreach Program](https://www.epa.gov/lmop/project-and-landfill-data-state) and the [GHG Reporting Program](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghg-reporting-program-data-sets). In the event this data is removed by the Agency, archived copies can be found in this repository or through the [Environmental Data & Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/archiving/)
